# IPO Allotment Rules

When a company issues shares through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the allotment of shares to investors is conducted based on specific rules that differ by investor category. Below are the allotment rules derived from the provided information:

## General Principles

- **Lot Size Basis**: Shares are allotted in lots, where each lot contains a fixed number of shares as defined by the issuer. Investors must apply for shares in multiples of the lot size.

- **Application Categories**:
  - An investor can apply in only one of the following categories:
    - Retail Individual Investor (RII)
    - Small Non-Institutional Investor (sNII)
    - Big Non-Institutional Investor (bNII)
  - If there are Employee or Shareholder reservation categories, investors may apply in these categories in addition to one of the above.

- **Valid Applications**: Only applications that meet all eligibility criteria are considered for allotment. Applications may be rejected for reasons such as incorrect details, multiple applications with the same PAN (meaning multiple application using same account), or bids below the issue price or using 3rd party UPI to pay for the application. 


## Investor Categories and Allotment Rules

### Retail Individual Investors (RII)

- **Definition**: Individuals who apply for shares worth less than ₹2 lakhs.
- **Allotment Process**:
  - **Under-subscribed Issue**:
    - All valid applicants receive the full number of shares they applied for.
  - **Over-subscribed Issue**:
    - **Lottery System**: A computerized draw is conducted.
    - **Allocation**:
      - Each successful applicant receives at least one lot, regardless of the number of lots applied for.
      - If the number of applicants is less than the maximum possible allottees, remaining shares are distributed on a pro-rata basis.
  - **Minimum Application Size**: 1 lot or approx ₹15,000
  - **Maximum Application Size**: less than ₹2 lakhs
  - **Bidding at Cut-off Price Allowed**: Yes

- **Example**: 
    - If there are a sufficient number of retail investors and applications for the first public offering, each retail investor will receive at least one lot. Lots are groups of shares sold in an initial public offering. In a Mainboard IPO, x shares are valued at approximately Rs 15,000. In a SME IPO, x shares are valued at around Rs 1,00,000. The issuance price and the number of shares per lot (lot size) are both publicized by the issuing company. The maximum number of retail investors who could get allotment in an IPO is derived by dividing the total number of shares offered in the retail reserved category by the lot size.

    - Maximum Retail Investors (allotees) = (Total shares offered in the retail category) / (IPO lot size)

    - For example, let’s take the example of the TATA Technologies IPO. 1,84,57,919 shares were reserved for retail. The lot size of the IPO is 30 shares. Maximum Retail Investors (Allotees) = 1,84,57,919 / 30 = 6,15,264 investors.

    - Basis of Allotment
    Scenario 1: If 6,00,000 investors apply for 1,80,00,000 shares, all investors receive the full allotment because the retail category is not fully subscribed.

    - Scenario 2: If 7,00,000 investors apply for 2,00,00,000 shares, it is not possible to allocate at least one lot to each investor because there are only 18487919 shares for retail. In this case, the allocation is made by a computerized lottery system.

    - Scenario 3: If 6,00,000 investors apply for 2,00,00,000 shares, each investor will initially be allocated at least one lot, i.e.30 shares. Of the remaining [18457919-(600000*30)] 18457919 shares, the allotment is then made on a proportionate basis.
